<h3 id="scenario--">Scenario -</h3>

<p>Your best friend missed the first week of class. They did catch-up reading but are still struggling with mathematical statements, particularly implications. Explain what a mathematical statement is. Explain when an implication is true or false. Be sure to include at least two examples of statements and two examples of implications (and their truthness).</p>

<h3 id="response--">Response -</h3>

<p>A mathematical statement is made up of an assumption and a conclusion. Implications are an if then relationship. Implications are always true unless, the condition is met but the outcome is not as expected.</p>

<p>if I go to the movies =&gt; I will by popcorn</p>

<p>This statement is only false If i go to the movies and do not buy popcorn. If I decide to not go to the movies then it is automatically true.</p>
