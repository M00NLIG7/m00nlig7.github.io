<h3 id="scenario--">Scenario -</h3>

<p>Explain the trichotomy between bit-strings, binomial coefficients, and lattice paths. Be sure to include at least two examples.</p>

<h3 id="response--">Response -</h3>

<p>Bit-strings, lattice paths, and binomial coefficients all coresepond.</p>

<p>‚Äún choose k‚Äù is the number of n-bit strings of weight k. n is the same as the number of lattice paths, and as we know each lattice path is a bit string. This is the correspondence between bit-strings, lattice paths, and binomial coefficients.</p>

<h3 id="example-1">Example 1:</h3>

<p>In how many ways, it is possible to draw exactly 6 cards from a pack of 10 cards?</p>

<h3 id="solution-1">Solution 1:</h3>

<p>So there are 10 possible cards or, lattice paths/bit strings (n). 6 is the amount we wish to get or the weight (k). In this way we know our binomial coefficient to be $10\choose 6$. We then must compute the formula $\frac{10!}{6!(10-6)!}$ which ends up being 210 meaning there are 210 ways of drawing 6 cards form a pack of 10.</p>

<h3 id="example-2">Example 2:</h3>

<p>In how many ways, it is possible to enchant a diamond pickaxe with 3 enchantments with no repeats when there are 5 possible enchants?</p>

<h3 id="solution-2">Solution 2:</h3>

<p>So there are 5 possible enchants or, lattice paths/bit strings (n). We want to enchant our pickaxe with 3 of these making out weight 3 (k). This makes our binomial coefficient $5\choose 3$. We then must compute the formula $\frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!}$ which ends up being 10 meaning there are 10 ways to enchant a diamond pickaxe with 3 different enchantments.</p>
