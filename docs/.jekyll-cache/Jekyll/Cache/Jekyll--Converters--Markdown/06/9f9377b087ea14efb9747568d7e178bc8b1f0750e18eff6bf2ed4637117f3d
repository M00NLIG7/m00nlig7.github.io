<p>Your best friend missed the first week of class. They did catch-up reading but are still struggling with mathematical statements, particularly implications. Explain what a mathematical statement is. Explain when an implication is true or false. Be sure to include at least two examples of statements and two examples of implications (and their truthness).</p>

<h3 id="response--">Response -</h3>

<p>A mathematical statement is made up of an assumption and a conclusion. Implications are an if then relationship. So if i go the movies, I will buy popcorn. Implications are only false when the A condition is true but b is false.</p>
