<p>Suppose you had the role of instructor for this course. Scary, I know. You’ve taught this class a few times and you notice that students always have trouble distinguishing between subsets and membership. Explain each concept and how they differ. Be sure to include at least two examples.</p>

<h3 id="response--">Response -</h3>

<p>Subsets and membership are two similar concepts. However, membership is simple when an element is in a specified set.
For example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>3 ∈ A</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this case we are showing 3 being an element of A. In essence membership is when an element shows up in a set.</p>

<p>Subsets are when all elements of one set appear in another.
For example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>B = {1 , 2, 3}</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>B ⊂ A</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So because every element in set B shows up in set A, B is a subset of A.</p>

<p>Note the use of the ⊂ sign rather than the ⊆ sign. This is because this is a proper subset. A proper subset essentially means the two sets differ in some way.</p>
