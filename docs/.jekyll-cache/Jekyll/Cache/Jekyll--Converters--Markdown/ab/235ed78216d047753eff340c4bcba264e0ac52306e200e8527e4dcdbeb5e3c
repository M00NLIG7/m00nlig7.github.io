<p>Two aliens, Alice and Bob, come to Earth. Confused about all the comings and goings they find themself attempting to make sense of the binomial identity: ${n\choose k} = {n\choose n-k}$. You run into them deliberating at Tea Terminals on University. Help Alice and Bob by explaining the binomial identity in at least two different ways!</p>

<h3 id="response--">Response -</h3>

<p>At itâ€™s core $n \choose k$ is what you actually choose and $n\choose n-k$ is whatever you didnt choose.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

\[A=\{a,b,c,d\}\]

\[{4\choose 2} \longleftrightarrow {4\choose 4-2}\\\{A,B\} \longleftrightarrow \{C,D\} \\\{A,C\} \longleftrightarrow \{B,D\} \\\{A,D\} \longleftrightarrow \{B,C\} \\\{B,C\} \longleftrightarrow \{A,D\} \\\{B,D\} \longleftrightarrow \{A,C\} \\\{C,D\} \longleftrightarrow \{A,B\} \\\]

<p>As you can see above the set on the right is the objects that were not chosen and the set on the left is the objects that were chosen.</p>

<p>Lets say for example you are playing a game of kickball. There are n amount of players to pick from and you get to pick all of your players first, this is $n\choose k$. Now since you picked your team first the other team is stuck with whoever wasnt picked which happens to be n-k.</p>

<p>When you make the choice to include k objects you are essentially also making the choice not to include n-k objects.</p>

<p>I will admit heavy inspiration was taken from this <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/849758/why-n-choose-k-n-choose-n-k">stack article</a>, but it really helped me understand this binomial identity.</p>
