<p>This week will be a holistic journal entry. Get out and go for a walk and think about what we’ve done in class. Reflect on what you’ve learned and, more importantly, what you still don’t understand. Write about a problem or concept that you found confusing.</p>

<p>Most of what i dont understand comes from PIE. More specifically avanced counting with PIE.</p>

<p>I understand the $(stars+bars)\choose 1$ $(stars+bars)\choose 2$ $(stars+bars)\choose 3$ part but not the rest. For example with the problem</p>

<p>There are $4^5$ functions total. Using PIE we can find the number of functions which are not surjective and subtract them from the total. The number of functions which are not surjective is:
\({4\choose 1} {3^5} - {4\choose 2} {2^5} + {4\choose 3} {1^5}\)</p>

<p>I fully understand the $4\choose i$ part but not the ${3^5}$ ${2^5}$ ${1^5}$</p>

<p>For the most part this is the only thing i dont understand</p>
