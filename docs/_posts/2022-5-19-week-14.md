## MATH 2720 (01) - DISCRETE MATHEMATICS

### Chapter 2 Summary Problem 6:

Consider the sequence given recursively by
a*1 = 4, a_2 = 6 and $a_n =a*{n−1} + a\_{n−2}$

A.) Write out the first 6 terms of the sequence.

$$4, 6, 10, 16, 26, 42...$$

B.) Could the closed formula for $a_n$ be a polynomial? Explain.

Lets check:

6 - 4 = 2
10 - 6 = 4
16 - 10 = 6
26 - 16 = 10
42 - 26 = 16

4 - 2 = 2
6 - 4 = 2
10 - 6 = 4
16 - 10 = 6

If we keep subtracting we will never see a constant difference meaning $a_n$ cannot be expressed as a polynomial.
