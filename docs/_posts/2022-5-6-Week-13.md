## MATH 2720 (01) - DISCRETE MATHEMATICS

## Week 13

### Scenario -

Euclid's lemma tells us that if p is a prime number and p divides ab, then p divides a or p divides b. Use Euclid's lemma to prove (by contradiction), that $\sqrt{3}$ is irrational.

### Response -

Let us assume that $\sqrt{3}$. Then $\sqrt{3} = p/q$ for some integers p and q.
Then,\
$\sqrt{3} = p/q$\
$p = \sqrt{3} q$\
$p^2 = 3q^2$\
This shows 3 is a factor of p. So p = 3d for some integer d. We also p and q must not share a factor by defintion of a prime.\
$(3d)^2/3 = q^2$\
$9d^2/3 = q^2$\
$(3d)^2 = q^2$\
$d^2 = q^2/3$\
This means 3 is also a factor q. \
Thus $\sqrt{3}$ is irrational.
