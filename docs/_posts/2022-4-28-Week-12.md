## MATH 2720 (01) - DISCRETE MATHEMATICS

## Week 12

### Scenario -

Explain direct proofs in your own words. Give an example of one and explain how it is a direct proof.

### Response -

A direct proof is pretty much just a way of showing whether a statment is true or false (Assume P. Explain, explain, â€¦, explain. Therefore Q.)

For all integers n, if n is even then $n^2$ is even.

Assume n is even. Then n = 2k for some integer k. So,\
$n^2 = (2k)^2$\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$= 4k^2$\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$= 2(2k)^2$\
Thus $n^2$ is even. //
