## MATH 2720 (01) - DISCRETE MATHEMATICS

## Week 2

### Scenario -

Suppose you had the role of instructor for this course. Scary, I know. You’ve taught this class a few times and you notice that students always have trouble distinguishing between subsets and membership. Explain each concept and how they differ. Be sure to include at least two examples.

### Response -

Subsets and membership are two similar concepts. However, membership is simple when an element is in a specified set.
For example:

> A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

> 3 ∈ A

In this case we are showing 3 being an element of A. In essence membership is when an element shows up in a set.

Subsets are when all elements of one set appear in another.
For example:

> A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

> B = {1 , 2, 3}

> B ⊂ A

So because every element in set B shows up in set A, B is a subset of A.
