## MATH 2720 (01) - DISCRETE MATHEMATICS

### Chapter 3 Summary Problem 9:

Prove the statement: For all integers a,b, and c, if $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ , then a or b is even

Suppose that a and b are odd such that a = 2k+1 and b = 2m+1 for some integers k and m.

Then

$$a^2 + b^2 = ({2k+1})^2 + ({2m+1})^2$$
$$= 4k^2 + 4k + 1 + 4m^2 + 4m + 1$$
$$ = 4(k^2 + k^2 + m + k) + 2$$

$c^2$ cannot be odd because above it is shown that c^2 is even.

Therefore a or b is even. //
