## MATH 2720 (01) - DISCRETE MATHEMATICS

## Week 1

### Scenario -

Your best friend missed the first week of class. They did catch-up reading but are still struggling with mathematical statements, particularly implications. Explain what a mathematical statement is. Explain when an implication is true or false. Be sure to include at least two examples of statements and two examples of implications (and their truthness).

### Response -

A mathematical statement is made up of a hypothesis and a conclusion. Implications are an if then relationship. Implications are always true unless, the condition is met but the outcome is not as expected.

> if I go to the movies => I will buy popcorn

This statement is only false If i go to the movies and do not buy popcorn. If I decide to not go to the movies then it is automatically true.

Another example of an implication would be:

> if i am going to work => I will drink coffee in the morning.

Once again this statemetn is only false if i go to work and do not drink coffee in the morning.
