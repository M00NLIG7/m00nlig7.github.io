## MATH 2720 (01) - DISCRETE MATHEMATICS

### Chapter 1 Combinatorial Proof

I hope its ok that i did this but i combined the script you wanted us to write and the worked problem

6.) Consider the identiy:
$$n{n\choose k} = n{n-1\choose k-1}$$

A.) Is this true? Try it for a few values of n and k.

This is true, I even made a python program to confirm this.

```python
"""
This program uses the custom functions i made along with the builtin random library to generate random binomial coefficient to computer and then applies the identity from question 6. After running this several times I can confirm it always outputs to true.
"""
from math import factorial
import random

def comb(n, k):
    return factorial(n) // (factorial(k) * factorial(n-k))

def question_six_identity(n, k):
    return k*comb(n,k) == n*comb(n-1, k-1)

print(question_six_identity(random.randint(25, 50), random.randint(5, 25)))
```

B.) Algebraic proof:
$$k{n\choose k} = \frac{kn!}{k!(n-k)!} = \frac{n!}{(k-1)!(n-k)!} = \frac{n(n-1)!}{(k-1)!(n-k)!} = n{ {n-1}\choose{k-1}}$$

C.) Combinatorial proof: \
The CSUSB CISO program is searching for board members. They must choose $k$ students from $n$ students to join the board AND they must also choose who will be the club president. CPP's CISO program must also find a club president AND must choose $k-1$ remaining students from the $n-1$ remaining students.
