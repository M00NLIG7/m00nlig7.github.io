## MATH 2720 (01) - DISCRETE MATHEMATICS

```python
# There are multiple ways to show recurrence relations in python

# Now traditionally you would just use reccurence itself. I will be using the traditional Fibonacci Sequence for my example


# Recusive function call in python

def fib(n):
     if n in {0, 1}:  # Base case
         return n
     return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)


print([fib(n) for n in range(15)]) # This will us the first 15 terms

# Generators in python

def fib(n):
    # Base Case
    a = 0
    b = 1
    for _ in range(n):
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

print(list(fib(15))) # This will also give us the first 15 terms

# While these two might give the same output one is "more correct" than the other

# Generators in python maintain their state so you so you can resume where you left off

# That yield means it will essentiall return that value then go back and resume the code

# In our example it will give back a -> then it will set a equal to b while simultaniously setting b to a + b.

# If we did not use the single line notation a, b = b, a + b we would have to declare a third variable c. That code is shown below

def fib(n):
    # Base Case
    a = 0
    b = 1
    for _ in range(n):
        yield a
        c = a
        a = b
        b = b + c

# As you can see here this is just taking up more space in memory for a variable c

# The reason generators are more efficient than recursion is because generators are continous where as recrursively
# called functions must redo all the calculations for every nth term
