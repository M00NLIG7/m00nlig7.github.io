## MATH 2720 (01) - DISCRETE MATHEMATICS

### Chapter 1 Summary Problem 7:

Recall, by 8-bit strings, we mean strings of binary digits, of length 8.

A.) How many 8-bit strings are there total?

There were $2^8$ bit strings total.

B.) How many 8-bit strings have weight 5?

The number of bit strings of weight 5 is $8\choose{5}$

C.) How many subsets of the set contain exactly 5 elements?

This is same as the previous question so $8\choose{5}$

D.) Explain why your answers to parts (b) and (c) are the same. Why are these questions equivalent?

The weight of a bit string is the number of ones it contains. We can look at each subset of a set containing exactly 5 elements as a 1. This gives us $8\choose{5}$ subsets
