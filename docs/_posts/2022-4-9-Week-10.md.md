## MATH 2720 (01) - DISCRETE MATHEMATICS

## Week 10

### Scenario -

Mathematical induction often gets compared to dominos. Some people also like to compare it to climbing a ladder. Formulate the analogy of mathematical induction with climbing a ladder.

### Response -

With the dominoes analogy for induction all it is doing is making sure that one dominoe hits the nexts dominoe. In reference to a ladder it would almost be like saying if you can climb up $step_n$ on the ladder then you can also go up $step_{n+1}$
