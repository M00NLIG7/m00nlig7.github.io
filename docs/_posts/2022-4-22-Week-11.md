## MATH 2720 (01) - DISCRETE MATHEMATICS

## Week 11

### Scenario -

Explain truth tables in your own words. Be sure to detail how to construct them, examples, and deduction.

### Response -

Truth tables are essentially a way to view all outcomes of a statement by evauluating each outcome as true or false.

For Example:

---

| P | Q | P $\land$ Q |\
| T | T | &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|\
| T | F | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;F &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|\
| F | T | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|\
| F | F | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|

---

This is showing each of the possibilities for $P\land Q$

This can be shown in python as so:

```py

P = True
Q = True

print(P and Q)

P = True
Q = False

print(P and Q)

P = False
Q = True

print(P and Q)

P = False
Q = False

print(P and Q)
```

Which outputs:

```
True
False
False
False
```
