Cyber Security Specialist || CISO CSUSB

"My primary goal of hacking was the intellectual curiosity, the seduction of adventure." ~ Kevin Mitnick

### Introduction

My name is Christian Magana and I am a 18-year-old university student with a passion for cybersecurity. I am a part of CISO and the CCDC team here at CSUSB and am continuing to hone my cybersecurity skills. In the future, I am looking to become a CyberCorps SFS student in order to pursue my passion and enter the field. In my spare time I enjoy doing Hack the Box challenges, coding, playing video games, and most of all spending time with my girlfriend.
